# PHP Recursive Data Processing with Inadequate Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a PHP code example showcasing a common error in recursive data processing: insufficient error handling for unexpected input formats. The function `processData` intends to process data containing '@' symbols, extracting key-value pairs. However, it fails to handle cases with multiple '@' symbols or other irregularities within nested arrays. This can lead to unexpected results or even errors.

## Bug Description
The `processData` function recursively iterates through a nested array. If an element is a string containing '@', it's split into key-value pairs.  However, if a string has multiple '@' symbols (like an email address), the `explode` function will produce an incorrect number of parts, causing unexpected behavior. The current error handling only issues a warning; more robust error management is required, such as throwing an exception or logging the error effectively.

## Solution
The provided solution improves error handling by using a `try-catch` block to manage potential `ValueError` exceptions resulting from incorrect input formats.  It also provides more informative error messages and allows for better control over how such issues are addressed (e.g., skipping problematic data or terminating processing).
